It starts at the bottom of the tree, showing a man kneeling with a book in his hand and a halo on his head. Then it shows the base of the tree that says ""Roma."" The video then starts to focus on the branches of the tree. These branches all say different places on them. ",astrology;religion;horoscope;catholicism,"Rome, Italy",,,,K632a,video,youtube,Latin,,
coll003,IMG_1193.jpeg,,,Ars magna lucis et umbrae,Athanasius Kircher,1646,"This image is a section of the tree page video. It has very intricate detailing around the border and an image of what appears to be a spiritual being in clouds and a halo around their head. From that image, one can infer that the particular section refers to religion. The print has the crest representing the church and implies that Christianity is being spread. At the bottom of the cones, there appears to be an angel's head speaking God's word in various languages. The images in this section are meant to depict the spreading of Christianity to multiple regions of the world. The spread is communicated via the languages represented. The detailing provided in the page section and across the entire page itself defines the budget in the book's production. The budget for the book is a significant sum; however, the book is not meant for a personal library. It is not written by or for aristocrats because of the lack of ornate work on the borders of gold leaf detailing. The usage of total pages also tells the story that each page is meant to be utilized to its most remarkable ability. ",,"Rome, Italy",,,,K632a,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,Multi-lingual ,,

One of the first things you see in this video is the words ""Horoscopium Catholicum Society. IESV,"" which translates to ""Catholic Horoscope Society."" As the video continues, it shows the four corners of the page. On each corner, there are phrases in several different languages. There are also pictures of a man in the clouds with a halo praying in the corners.

coll005,IMG_1201.jpeg,,,Ars magna lucis et umbrae,Athanasius Kircher,1646,"The book is written on various topics, everything from astrology to Jesus and Christianity, which is interesting to see in the one book. The particular page is written in Latin. The bold title on the page states “CAPVT VIL,” which google indicates to mean head in Latin. Translating a few sentences on the page, I found the section refers to the movement of stars and the effects of the various placements. The text also speaks about longitude and latitude, meeting at the median, and forming the equator around the earth. The page is filled with writing, and the margins are not as comprehensive as seen in other scripts. There is no intricate detailed border; only one detailed yet straightforward square all points towards the means of production. The page ultimately utilized and the lack of extravagant borders examples that an aristocrat did not write the book for personal use, yet it was meant to be read by various people; however, the budget is still of a weather individual.

coll006,IMG_2063.jpeg,,,Ars magna lucis et umbrae,Athanasius Kircher,1646,"This image depicts a man in the center of an astrology chart. The photo covers an entire page; it features words and drawings. The man is at the center of the page, drawing the most attention from the reader. One hand is chained, and one holds the sun. One foot is placed on a sphere of stars and the other on a singular star. His body is cut open, revealing his organs and a star in the center of his groin area. He is standing upon a city, and there are men in the clouds above him. On the left and right of the man is a chart that aligns with the months and their corresponding zodiac signs. The symbol for each zodiac sign is drawn next to the month. Stars connect together like constellations to each of the man’s body parts. The drawing seems to portray that man is internally connected to the stars.",,"Rome, Italy",,,,K632a,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,,,

coll009,IMG_3906.jpg,,,Ars magna lucis et umbrae,Athanasius Kircher,1646,"This image is of what appears to be the chapter's title page. Various titles and descriptions are written in bold to grasp the reader's attention. In this section of the page, the Latin writing is on Athanasius Kircher, a Jesuit priest, and his writings on how astronomy could reveal the secrets of the heavens on earth to human beings. The study of astronomy in the section is seen as an insight to the world of God and the heavens above. The work of how astrology can lead to new discovery is indicated. The text even continues on to mention that the human form is of “ a divine fire which known no form of rest.” The translated writing on the page points towards the desire to find peace for human beings. The margins of the page remain bare, and the detailing is left to the minimal decoration to just one letter M. However, the space in the long and bold title shows that though the text is not for the wealth, it is not for the poor. The book is indicated through pages and lacks decoration to be a text for scholars. ",,"Rome, Italy",,,,K632a,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,Latin ,,

It also has capital letters that label parts of the tool. The bottom of the page is decorated with an emblem portraying that it does have decorative elements though the text is not ornate.

coll011,IMG_3908.jpg,,,Ars magna lucis et umbrae,Athanasius Kircher,1646,"The title of this page is “Problema III - Instrumentum opticum preparare,” which translates to “prepare an optical instrument.” The page has a paragraph of information and a large picture in the middle of the page. Since the title mentions an optical instrument, I'm assuming the diagram is some sort of instrument having to do with light and shadows. The writing and the picture are connected or related in some way. It looks like there are capital letters on the diagram or instrument, so the person reading the book might potentially use the information in the paragraph or on other pages to fill in the chart and label it. This book has a lot to do with astrology, so this instrument might have been used to test an idea related to it. The diagram is the central part of the page, which makes me believe it was an important instrument and the writer wanted the audience to focus more on it than the writing itself. The diagram is also very detailed and easy to follow. ",science;optical phenomenon;light,"Rome, Italy",,,,K632a,Image;StillImage,image/jpeg,Latin,,
